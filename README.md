# Sly Bevy Jam2

[Bevy Jam 2](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-2)

Theme is COMBINE

Day 1

* Started from with from NiklasEi [template](https://github.com/NiklasEi/bevy_game_template) 
* Setup my physics and camera system, loading screens, debug overlay
* Got wasm build working
* Addded and then removed bevy-sequential-actions, wtf, defeats the entire benifit of the ecs system
* Added bevy_tweening, first time using but looks promising
* Worked on ui, most likely shouldn't be working on this yet
